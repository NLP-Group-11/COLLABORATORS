# Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:
1.	Develop a web-based hate speech detection system that processes transcribed speech input in multiple languages
2.	Implement robust text processing techniques to handle the unique characteristics of transcribed speech
3.	Utilize the existing multilingual hate speech dataset to train an effective detection model
4.	Build a user-friendly interface for inputting or uploading transcribed speech for analysis
5.	Achieve near real-time processing and analysis of transcribed speech content
6.	Attain a minimum accuracy of 90% in hate speech detection across supported languages.
